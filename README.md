# Human-Perception-Aware-Adversarial-Examples

In this repository I experiment with including human eye-tracking data into the process of crafting adversarial examples. 
I therefore re-use the data a grad student gathered during their master's thesis work at our group at MCI. The data was gathered with a Tobii eye-tracking device.
