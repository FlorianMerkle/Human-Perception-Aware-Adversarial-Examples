# Human-Perception-Aware-Adversarial-Examples

In this repository I experiment with including human eye-tracking data into the process of crafting adversarial examples. 
I therefore re-use the data a grad student gathered during their master's thesis work at our group at MCI. The data was gathered with a Tobii eye-tracking device.

The intuition is that by giving the attack knowledge on which areas humans use mostly to evaluate an image, an adversarial perturbation can be found that is even less perceptible for humans as its strongest parts are outside the human attention field.
